As an open source code base and version control system, Github has more than 9 million developer users. As more and more applications move to the cloud, Github has become the preferred way to manage software development and discover existing code. 
 as mentioned earlier, as a distributed version control system, There is no such concept as the main library in Git. Each copied library can be used independently, and any inconsistencies between the two libraries can be merged. 
 GitHub can host various git libraries and provide a web interface. But unlike the services of foreign SourceForge,Google Code or China's coding, the unique selling point of GitHub is the simplicity of branching from another project. Contributing code to a project is simple: first click on the "fork" button on the project site, and then check out the code and add the changes to the code base you just separated. Finally, through the built-in "pull request" mechanism to apply to the project manager code merge. There are already people who call GitHub the code player's MySpace.
 to branch in GitHub, just like in Myspace (or Facebook.). The 
 GitHub project itself is naturally hosted on the GitHub, except in a private, invisible library of public views. Open source projects can be hosted free of charge, but private libraries are not. Chris Wanstrath,GitHub, one of the developers, affirmed the plan to financially support the hosting of toll-free libraries through paid private libraries. 
 Yes, that's what we planned. By reaching out to customers, developing FamSpam, and even developing GitHub itself, GitHub's private library has proven value for money. Anyone who wants to save time and want to be as far away from frequent page transitions as the rest of the team will get the value they really want from GitHub. 
 GitHub, users can easily find vast amounts of open source code.
